**What is Spring?
**

Spring is a framework for developing java applications with wide range of functionalities.


**What is Spring Boot?
**

It is an extension of the spring framework which simplifies creating production level applications by providing auto configurations, simplifies the setup process and running process. it achieves this using an embedded server, auto configuration and production ready features.
What is the relation between Spring platform and Spring Boot?
  Essentially, Spring Boot builds on the foundational capabilities provided by the Spring Framework and other Spring projects to streamline the development process.


**What is the relation between Spring platform and Spring framework?
**  

The Spring Framework is the core of the Spring Platform. It provides the fundamental features and capabilities that other Spring projects build upon. The Spring Platform is an aggregation of these projects, offering a comprehensive suite of tools and libraries for building enterprise applications. The Spring Framework is at the heart of this platform, providing core features like dependency injection, aspect-oriented programming, transaction management, and more.


**What is Dependency Injection and how is it done in the Spring platform/framework?
**

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used to achieve Inversion of Control (IoC) between classes and their dependencies. Instead of a class instantiating its dependencies directly, the dependencies are injected into the class by an external entity, typically a container or framework.



**What is Inversion of Control (IoC) and how is it related to Spring?
**

Inversion of Control (IoC) is a design principle where the control of object creation and management is transferred from the application code to a container or framework. This principle allows for greater flexibility, modularity, and ease of testing.
 In the context of the Spring Framework, IoC is implemented through the Spring IoC container, which is responsible for managing the lifecycle and dependencies of objects (beans) in the application.
